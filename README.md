# Data Management and Visualization 

"I'm not paying for baggage insurance, quite sure it won't be lost".

This is the classic phrase of those about to travel.
The loss of airline baggage at airports check-in is a low-frequency phenomenon, nevertheless it causes unpleasant situations especially if the owner is preparing for a long stay.
Analyzing large volumes of data, this project aims to point out the safest route and to understand whether the colour can influence or not the loss ratio.
