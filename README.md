### About 

"Not interested in baggage insurance, quite sure my luggage won't be lost".

This is a typical answer of those about to travel.
Even though there are little chances to loose baggages at airport check-in, unpleasant situations could arise when it happenes.
Analyzing large volumes of data, this project aims at pointing out the best route in terms of loss ratio and understanding whether the luggages colours could be relevant.
